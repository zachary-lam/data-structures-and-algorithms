# Data Structures & Algorithms

This repository serves as my learning notes for studying Data Structures & Algorithms.

The book being used to study is "*Growing Algorithms & Data Structures*" from the COMP-1020 course at the University of Manitoba. 

The file structure is sorted by chapters, mostly consisting of Markdown files where my notes are contained. Every now and then, Python and Java files will be included with sample code alongside inline comments to help assist in my learning.
